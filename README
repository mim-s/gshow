Usage: gshow [OPTION]... [GROUP]
Show information about groups.

GROUP may be a group name or GID.

With no GROUP, output all regular groups.

With GROUP, output exactly two lines:
  1. users whose primary group is GROUP
  2. users with GROUP as a supplementary group

Options:
  -v, --verbose            show all regular groups in verbose format
  -e, --empty              show regular groups with no members
                           no output if there are none
  -p, --primary            show users whose primary group is GROUP
                           no output if there are none
  -s, --supplementary      show users with GROUP as a supplementary group
                           no output if there are none
  -i, --id                 also print UIDs/GIDs
  -d, --delimiter=DELIM    set output delimiter (default: space)
      --help               display this help and exit

Exit status:
  0     if OK,
  1     if the syntax is not followed,
  2     if GROUP does not exist.
